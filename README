The goal of this project is to create C++ classes and functions that will 
assist programers in solving projectEuler problems. 

Files in the project will never give solutions to any problems. They are here 
to provide easy functionality to C++ users that other high level languages 
already support.

All classes are designed around SGI's STL for easy portability between
operating systems.

Documentation on the classes can be found at:
