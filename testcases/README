Tested on a 2.7GHz machine. Centos 6.0.

- testcases_Primes.cpp
     * Should finish quickly with no failed asserts

- testcases_BigInt.cpp
     * most test cases should finish in reasonable amount of time.
     * addition and subtraction should take less than 10 seconds a piece
     * multiplication takes around 35 seconds on my machine
     * total time to finish around 45 seconds
